# About Me

Hello! I'm currently working as a security guard on a 12x36 shift schedule while dedicating my free hours to studying. I'm in the final semester of my Associate's degree in Software Analysis and Development. My native language is Portuguese, and I'm fluent in English.

This course marks the first step in my learning journey, as I aspire to become a software engineer. I'm passionate about technology and continually seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of software development.

Feel free to explore my repositories and projects. I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, and new opportunities.

Thank you for visiting my profile!
